    <h2>About QUANTEC Radiation</h2>
    <p>Advancing radiation oncology through evidence-based dose constraints and clinical research.</p>
</section>

<section class="content-section">
    <h3><i class="fas fa-history"></i> Our History</h3>
    <p>The original QUANTEC (Quantitative Analyses of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic) project was a landmark initiative in radiation oncology that provided the first comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines for normal tissue dose constraints.</p>
    
    <p>Building upon this foundation, QUANTEC Radiation continues this important work by maintaining, updating, and expanding these critical resources for the modern era of radiation therapy.</p>
